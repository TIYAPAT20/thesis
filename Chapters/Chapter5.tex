\lhead{Chapter 5. \emph{Results}}

\todo{Develop a checker/evaluator tool}

\todo{Present the results and discuss any differences between the findings and your initial predictions/hypothesis}

\todo{Table with results (e.g. avg, std, min, max) compared (statistically) with methods developed and methods from literature. Analyse the best method components. Charts (e.g. boxplots, obj vs time, LLH utilisation rate, etc). Visualise the solutions}

\todo{Interpret your experimental results - do not just present lots of data and expect the reader to understand it.
Evaluate what you have achieved against the aims and objectives you outlined in the introduction}
